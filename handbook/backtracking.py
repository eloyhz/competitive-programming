# A backtracking algorithm begins with an empty solution and extends the
# solution step by step. The search recusively goes through all different
# ways ho a solution can be constructed.

# As an example consider the problem of calculating the number of ways n
# queens can be placed on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens attack
# each other.

# The problem can be solved using backtracking by placing queens to the board
# row by row. More precisely, exactly one queen will be placed in each row so
# that no queen attacks any of the queens placed before. A solution has been
# found when all n queens have been placed on the board.
